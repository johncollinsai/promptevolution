See Claude 2, PROMPT EVOLUTION, for more details.

The code below implements a basic genetic algorithm loop with initialization, selection, crossover, mutation and truncation. The key Prompt Evolution aspects are:

Initializing the population by concatenating thinking styles and mutation prompts to the problem description
Defining mutation prompts and using them to mutate the task prompts
Evolving the population of prompts over generations for better performance on the problem
Some ways this could be extended:

Adding more mutation operators like Lamarckian mutation
Evolving the mutation prompts in addition to task prompts
Maintaining diversity in the population
Evaluating prompts on a batch of examples instead of just one
Using an LLM to generate prompt variations instead of predefined crossover/mutation
So in summary, this shows a simple Python framework for evolving prompts, which could be built on to implement more complexPrompt Evolution algorithms. The key is using an evolutionary loop to combine and mutate an initial set of diverse prompts and mutation directives.
